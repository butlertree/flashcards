# FlashCards Starter Kit

FlashCards Starter Kit is a project through Turing School of Software and Design.  The projcest required the student to apply existing code in the 
functionality of a flash card game that runs through the terminal.  The main focuse of the assignment was to apply TDD in the development of functions  
that would would eventually drive the game.  


## Technologies used

Mocha and Chai test suits are used to create TDD functions that drive the operation of the flash card game in the terminal.  



## Install/Setup instructions
Fort a copy of this repository form github [(https://github.com/butlertree/flashcards)].
Copy the SSH key into your terminal.
cd into the file and run node index.js in the comand line to play the game!!

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
